# Duty cycle and Frequency Controlled Signal using Verilog
We will make a signal in Verilog which will be a variable duty cycle as well as variable frequency signal which is named as pulse. We can refer this signal pulse as a square wave also with variable duty cycle. 

The picture of the simulation (The signal to be observed is named as pulse) is shown below:

Also, the video of the simulation is presented as:
